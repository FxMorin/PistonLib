## PistonLib
#### A mod/library that expands the piston system

This mod/library is a work in progress!  
I don't have much time to work on this, so any time your willing to give to help is great.

### TODO
- Major Cleanup
- JavaDoc
- WIKI
- Long piston's & Piston arms
- Blocks that can be placed on slime but break when the slime moves should not break if the block below has the `fused` sticky property
- Dual-sided piston
- Quarter Slime blocks

### Current Piston Features
- Configurable piston speed
- Configurable push limit
- Movable block entities
- Configurable sticky types
- Unlimited Sticky Groups (Slime, Honey, etc...)
- Individual sticky behaviour per block sides
- Pull only logic
- Large Quasi API
- Huge custom piston behavior API
- Huge custom piston stickiness API

### Other Features
- Half Slime/Honey/Powered/Redstone Lamp/Obsidian block
- Glue Block (Strong sticky)
- Togglable sticky block
- Sticky chain (chainstone)
- Axis-Locked blocks (only movable on one axis)
- Move counting block (power level based amount moved)
- All sided observer
- Slippery blocks (block fall when not attached to any solid blocks)
- Obsidian Slabs & Stairs
- Config system to toggle individual features

### Blocks that need textures
- axis_locked_block
- move_counting_block
